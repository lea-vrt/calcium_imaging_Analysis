#Calcium Imaging Analysis Pipeline (Healthy vs SMA)

This repository contains a full end-to-end pipeline for processing 2-photon calcium imaging recordings using Suite2p
, followed by signal preprocessing, feature extraction, and machine learning classification between Healthy and SMA conditions.
Although the current dataset is small (~8 recordings), the pipeline is modular and scalable, allowing for the easy addition of additional recordings.
